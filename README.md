### Hello, I am Khuong Nguyen.

I'm a person who went from flipping burgers üçî at McDonald's to coding as a Software Engineer üíª.  I'm all about that tech life now, bringing the best of both worlds ‚Äì leadership vibes from the fast-food grind and the coding finesse of a software ninja. Check out my GitHub to witness the glow-up ‚Äì from coding noob to building cool apps. üöÄ‚ú®

Over the past year, I developed skills in JavaScript, Python, Flask, and CSS. I've successfully completed two personal projects and contributed to a group project that highlight my technical capabilities during my at the App Academy bootcamp.

The first personal project, KhuongBnB, is an Express, JavaScript, and React-based website that takes inspiration from the popular rental booking site, Airbnb. The second project showcases my versatility in Flask, Python, and React, where I built a sports betting website. Additionally, collaborating with a team of three other junior developers, we built Kelp, a Yelp clone, in a one-week timeframe, using Python, Flask, and React.

As I eagerly anticipate each new day in my coding journey, I look forward to the exciting challenges ahead.
