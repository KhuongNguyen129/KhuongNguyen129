### Hi, I'm Khuong Nguyen!

I’m a front-end software developer with over a year of hands-on experience, including time as an intern and full-time associate. My work focuses on building clean, scalable interfaces with React, TypeScript, and Jotai.

I got my start in tech after completing App Academy’s full-stack engineering program, where I developed and shipped several web applications using JavaScript, Python, Flask, Express, and React. These included KhuongBnB, a rental booking site inspired by Airbnb, and a Flask-based sports betting platform. And I also contributed to a team project, Kelp, a Yelp clone built in one week.

I take pride in writing maintainable code, improving user experience, and continuing to grow in a fast-moving environment.

In my spare time, I enjoy exploring different restaurants in San Francisco and spending time with my 2 cats.
